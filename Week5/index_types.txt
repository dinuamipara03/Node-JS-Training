A MySQL index is a data structure that improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a database table. 

Types of MySQL Indexes

Primary Index
A primary index is automatically created when a primary key is defined on the table. It uniquely identifies each row in the TABLE, hence making sure that the values of the primary key are both unique and cannot be null. There can be only one primary index per table.

Unique Index
The unique index normally ensures that all values within a column are unique. Contrary to the primary index, a table may contain several unique indexes. This type of index comes in handy in scenarios when you want to enforce uniqueness on a column that doesn't form the primary key.

Full-Text Index
This index type is used with columns storing large quantities of text and facilitates very fast recovery of data based on complicated text-based searches.

Composite Index
A composite index is an index created on more than one column.

Spatial Index
Spatial indexes are applied to geographic data types and enable the effective management and querying of spatial data.

Creation of a index:
CREATE INDEX idx_column_name ON table_name (column_name);

Explaining the index:
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column_name = 'value';
