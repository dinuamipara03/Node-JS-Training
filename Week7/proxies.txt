Types:

Boolean
        If true, the clientâ€™s IP address is understood as the left-most entry in the X-Forwarded-For header.

        If false, the app is understood as directly facing the client and the clientâ€™s IP address is derived from req.socket.remoteAddress. This is the default setting.


IP Address 
        An IP address, subnet, or an array of IP addresses and subnets to trust as being a reverse proxy. The following list shows the pre-configured subnet names:

        loopback - 127.0.0.1/8, ::1/128
        linklocal - 169.254.0.0/16, fe80::/10
        uniquelocal - 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16, fc00::/7


Number
        Use the address that is at most n number of hops away from the Express application. req.socket.remoteAddress is the first hop, and the rest are looked for in the X-Forwarded-For header from right to left. A value of 0 means that the first untrusted address would be req.socket.remoteAddress, i.e. there is no reverse proxy.


Function
        Custom trust implementation.

            app.set('trust proxy', (ip) => {
            if (ip === '127.0.0.1' || ip === '123.123.123.123') return true // trusted IPs
            else return false
            })
